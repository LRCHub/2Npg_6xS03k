But we wrote this one, way back in the club days matters
When this was where it's at.
You know, fuck all that 15, 000, this was it, you know
And we just love it, and this is the kind of shit we was writin' on the side
'Cos we love to get down fo' boogie

Oh take it away, Frankie, baby!

I wanna ride all around, into the sun
And I won't be back 'til the morning comes
I'm gettin' down fo' boogie, all night long

I said come what come, all gather round, 'cos we're all gonna put it down
Get down fo' boogie, all night long, ow!

I wanna ride all around, into the sun
And I won't be back 'til the morning comes
I'm gettin' down fo' boogie, all night long

I'm gettin' down fo' boogie, down fo' boogie
I'm gettin' down fo' boogie, all night long, yes I do
I'm gettin' down fo' boogie, all night long, tell me, how 'bout you
I'm gettin' down fo' boogie, all night long

That's all folks!

Philadelphia, thank you very much for puttin' up with us tonight
Thank you
