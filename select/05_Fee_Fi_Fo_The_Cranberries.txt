Fee fi fo she smells his body
She smells his body
And it makes her sick to her mind
He has got so much to answer for
To answer for
To ruin a child's mind

So innocent and pure
Obscure
How could you get satisfaction
From the body of a child
You're ville, sick
Chorus

God protect the ones who help themselves
In their own way
It's true what people say
God protect the ones who help themselves
In their own way
He was sitting in her bedroom
In her bedroom
And now what should she do
She's got so much insecurity
And his impurity
It was a gathering gloom
How could you touch something
So innocent and pure
Obscure
How could you get satisfaction
From the body of a child
You;re vilem sick
Repeat Chorus twice
Fee fi fo
